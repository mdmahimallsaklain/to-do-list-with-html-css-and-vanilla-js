# Todo App

This is a simple **Todo List** application built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **LocalStorage** for storing tasks. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. If there are no tasks available, a message is displayed indicating the list is empty.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Easily add tasks to the todo list.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Click on a task to toggle its completion state.
- **Delete tasks**: Click on the trash icon to remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: All tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Empty state**: If there are no tasks available, a message is shown: *"There are no todo items available."*

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the todo list.
- **CSS**: Styling the todo list and icons.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for adding, deleting, and managing tasks.
- **LocalStorage**: To store and retrieve tasks, ensuring persistence across sessions.
